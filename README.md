# Education

This repository includes tutorials, notes and information I have curated to help me work. You may also find them useful.


## CTCI

This folders contains my working solutions to problems from *Cracking the Coding Interview*. This is mostly done in Python for speed of development, bit I have opted for Java for bit manipulation.

I may port them to Java or C++ in the future.
