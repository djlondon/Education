# Git 101

## Initialising

1. First create a repository on github.com
2. From the folder you wish to add to your repository, run `git init`
3. Add all files using `git add .`
4. Check the status with `git status`, this will show the files in the repository in green
5. Commit with `git commit -am "initial version"`
6. Link to your repository with `git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git`
7. Push to the online repository with `git push -u origin master`
8. To clone the repo use: `git clone https://https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git`

## Workflow

~~~
git pull                Pull changes
...                     Do some work
...                     Get project into working state 
git status              see what's changed 
$ git add X             track new files
...                     edit .gitignore to ignore files
$ git commit -am "..."  (take a snapshot)
git push                Push changes
~~~

## Zipping

To zip the current snapshot use:
`git archive master -o project.zip`

## Committing

After a `commit`, `status` should return nothing.

The -a option says to commit all the changes and additions you have made. 
The -m option says to include a one-line message describing the changes made since the last commit.
