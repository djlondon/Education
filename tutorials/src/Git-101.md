# Git 101

This document briefly details how one can set up a Git repository and use it. This is intended for beginners to Git and is in no way complete nor comprehensive. 

*I have used CAPS refer to parts to parts that are unique to your usage i.e. project names and file names.*

## Initialising

First create a repository on github.com or another Git platform. Then either:

**Add a directory to your repository:**

> 1. Run `git init` from that directory
> 2. Add all files using `git add .` or add particular files using `git add FILE/DIRECTORY`
> 3. Check the status with `git status`, this will show the files in the repository in green
> 4. Commit with `git commit -am "initial version"`
> 5. Link to your repository with `git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT.git`
> 6. Push to the online repository with `git push -u origin master`

**Download your git repository:**

To clone the repo use: `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT.git`

## Workflow

| `git pull`             |Pull changes                     |
| ---- 	                 | ----                            |
|...                     | Do some work                    |
|...                     | Get project into working state  |
|`git status`            | See what's changed              |
|`git add X`             | track new files                 |
|...                     | edit .gitignore to ignore files |
|`git commit -am "..."`  | Take a snapshot                 |
|`git push`              | Push changes                    |


## Branching

Branches allow changes to be made to the existing codebase whilst keeping the default (`master`) branch
unchanged. This is ideal for feature additions and code rewrites.

~~~bash
git checkout -b NEWBRANCHNAME
git commit -am "CHANGED X AND Y"
git push --set-upstream origin NEWBRANCHNAME
~~~

## Zipping

To zip the current snapshot use:

```
git archive BRANCHNAME -o PROJECT.zip
```

## Committing

The `-a` option says to commit all the changes and additions you have made.

The `-m` option says to include a one-line message describing the changes made since the last commit.
